COOLIFY PERSISTENT STORAGE SETUP
========================================

IMPORTANT: Follow these steps in Coolify to prevent database loss on redeploy!

Step 1: Open your application in Coolify Dashboard

Step 2: Go to "Storages" tab (left sidebar)

Step 3: Click "Add Volume" or "Add Storage"

Step 4: Configure the volume:
   - Source Path: /app/data
   - Destination Path: /app/data
   - Or if it asks for "Name": app-data
   - Or if it asks for "Mount Path": /app/data

Step 5: Save the storage configuration

Step 6: Redeploy your application

Step 7: Test - create some scores, then redeploy again - data should persist!

========================================
WHY THIS IS NEEDED
========================================

When you deploy with Dockerfile only (not docker-compose), 
Coolify doesn't automatically preserve volumes.

You MUST manually configure persistent storage in Coolify UI
for the /app/data directory where SQLite database is stored.

========================================
VERIFICATION
========================================

After setup:
1. Create a game and submit scores
2. Go to Coolify and click "Redeploy"
3. Check if your data still exists
4. If yes - setup is correct!
5. If no - check storage configuration again
